# Skill Sphere
The Skill Sphere is a micro-learning website prototype which is developed using Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide users with a structured and interactive learning experience. Python is used to handle backend logic and server-side operations, while the MySQL database stores user information, courses, and progress data. HTML defines the structure of the interface, CSS enhances the visual design and layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity to create a smooth and engaging learning environment. Together, these technologies form a functional prototype that supports quick, accessible, and user-friendly micro-learning.
